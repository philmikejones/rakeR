rakeR
=====

Create a spatial microsimulated data set in R using iterative proportional 
fitting ('raking').


Install
-------

Install the latest stable version from CRAN:

```{r install-cran, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("rakeR")
```

Or install the development version with `devtools`:

```{r install-rakeR, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Obtain devtools if you don't already have it installed
# install.packages("devtools")

# Install rakeR development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("philmikejones/rakeR")
```

Load the package with:

```{r load-rakeR}
library("rakeR")
```


Overview
--------

`rakeR` has three main functions.
The first stage is always to use `weight()` to produce a matrix of fractional weights.
This matrix stores weights for each individual in each zone.

From this weight matrix, `rakeR` has functions to create fractional weights (`extract()`) or integerised cases (`integerise()`), depending on your needs and use cases.
Fractional (`extract()`ed) weights are generally more accurate, while integer cases are probably the most intuitive to use and are useful as inputs
for further modeling.

To create fractional weights use `weight()` then `extract()`, and to produce integerised weights use `weight()` then `integerise()`.


Inputs
------

To perform the weighting you should supply two data frames.
One data frame should contain the constraint information (`cons`) with counts per category for each zone (e.g. census counts).
The other data frame should contain the individual--level data (`inds`), i.e. one row per individual.

In addition, it is necessary to supply a character vector with the names of the constraint variables in `inds` (`vars`).
This is so that `rakeR` knows which are the contraint variables and which variables it should be simulating as an output.

Below are examples of `cons`, `inds`, and `vars`.

```{r data}
cons <- data.frame(
  "zone"      = letters[1:3],
  "age_0_49"  = c(8, 2, 7),
  "age_gt_50" = c(4, 8, 4),
  "sex_f"     = c(6, 6, 8),
  "sex_m"     = c(6, 4, 3),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

inds <- data.frame(
  "id"     = LETTERS[1:5],
  "age"    = c("age_gt_50", "age_gt_50", "age_0_49", "age_gt_50", "age_0_49"),
  "sex"    = c("sex_m", "sex_m", "sex_m", "sex_f", "sex_f"),
  "income" = c(2868, 2474, 2231, 3152, 2473)
)

vars <- c("age", "sex")
```

It is _essential_ that the unique levels in the constraint variables in the 
`inds` data set match the variables names in the `cons` data set.
For example, `age_0_49` and `age_gt_50` are variable names in `cons` and the unique levels of the `age` variable in `inds` precisely match these:

```{r labels-test}
all.equal(
  levels(inds$age), colnames(cons[, 2:3])  # cons[, 1] is the id column
)
```

Without this, the functions do not know how to match the `inds` and `cons` data
and will fail so as not to return spurious results.


`weight()`
----------

(Re-)weighting is done with `weight()` which returns a data frame of raw weights.

```{r weight}
weights <- weight(cons = cons, inds = inds, vars = vars)
weights
```

The raw weights tell you how frequently each individual (`A`-`E`) should appear 
in each zone (`a`-`c`).
The raw weights are useful when validating and checking performance of the
model, so it can be necessary to save these separately.
They aren't very useful for analysis however, so we can `extract()` or `integerise()` them into a useable form.


`extract()`
-----------

`extract()` produces aggregated totals of the simulated data for each category in each zone.
`extract()`ed data is generally more accurate than `integerise()`d data, although the user should be careful this isn't spurious precision based on context and knowledge of the domain.
Because `extract()` creates a column for each level of each variable, numerical variables (e.g. income) must be removed or `cut()` (otherwise the result would include a new column for each unique numerical value):

```{r extract}
inds$income <- cut(inds$income, breaks = 2, include.lowest = TRUE,
                   labels = c("low", "high"))

ext_weights <- extract(weights, inds = inds, id = "id")
ext_weights
```

`extract()` returns one row per zone, and the total of each category (for
example female and male, or high and low income) will match the known 
population.


`integerise()`
--------------

The `integerise()` function produces a simulated data frame populated with simulated individuals.
This is typically useful when:

* You need to include numerical variables, such as income in the example.
* You want individual cases to use as input to a dynamic or agent-based model.
* You want 'case studies' to illustrate characteristics of individuals in an
area.
* Individual-level data is more intuitive to work with.

```{r integerise}
int_weights <- integerise(weights, inds = inds)
int_weights[1:6, ]
```

`integerise()` returns one row per case, and the number of rows will match
the known population (taken from `cons`).


`rake()`
--------

`rake()` is a wrapper for `weight() %>% extract()` or 
`weight() %>% integerise()`.
This is useful if the raw weights (from `weight()`) are not required.
The desired output is specified with the `output` argument, which can be 
specified with `"fraction"` (the default) or `"integer"`.
The function takes the following arguments in all cases:

* `cons`
* `inds`
* `vars`
* `output` (default `"fraction"`)
* `iterations` (default 10)

Additional arguments are required depending on the output requested.
For `output = "fraction"`:

* `id`

For `output = "integer"`:

* `method` (default `"trs"`)
* `seed` (default 42)

Details of these context-specific arguments can be found in the
respective documentation for `integerise()` or `extract()`.

```{r rake-int-exaple}
rake_int <- rake(cons, inds, vars, output = "integer",
                 method = "trs", seed = 42)
rake_int[1:6, ]
```

```{r rake-frac-example}
rake_frac <- rake(cons, inds, vars, output = "fraction", id = "id")
rake_frac
```
