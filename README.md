rakeR
=====

Create a spatial microsimulated data set in R using iterative proportional fitting ('raking').

Install
-------

Install the latest stable version from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("rakeR")
```

Or install the development version with `devtools`:

``` r
# Obtain devtools if you don't already have it installed
# install.packages("devtools")

# Install rakeR development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("philmikejones/rakeR")
```

Load the package with:

``` r
library("rakeR")
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'rakeR'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     simulate
```

Overview
--------

The overall process of microsimulating a data set is to `weight()` then `integerise()`, or `weight()` then `extract()`. These return integer cases or fractional weights, respectively. Integer cases are probably the most intuitive to use and are useful as inputs for further modeling, but `extract()`ed fractional weights can be more precise.

Inputs
------

To perform the weighting you should supply two data frames, one with the constraint information (`cons`) with counts per category for each zone (e.g. census counts) and one with individual--level data, i.e. one row per individual (`inds`).

In addition, supply a character vector with the names of the constraint variables in `inds` (`vars`). This is so that any dependent variables included in `inds` (for example `income` below) are only used as output, not as part of the constraint process.

``` r
cons <- data.frame(
  "zone"   = letters[1:3],
  "a0_49"  = c(8, 2, 7),
  "a_gt50" = c(4, 8, 4),
  "f"      = c(6, 6, 8),
  "m"      = c(6, 4, 3),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

inds <- data.frame(
  "id"     = LETTERS[1:5],
  "age"    = c("a_gt50", "a_gt50", "a0_49", "a_gt50", "a0_49"),
  "sex"    = c("m", "m", "m", "f", "f"),
  "income" = c(2868, 2474, 2231, 3152, 2473)
)

vars <- c("age", "sex")
```

It is *essential* that the unique levels in the constraint variables in the `inds` data set match the variables names in the `cons` data set. For example, `a0_49` and `a_gt50` are variable names in `cons`. The unique levels of the `age` variable in `inds` precisely match these:

``` r
all.equal(
  levels(inds$age), colnames(cons[, 2:3])
)
#> [1] TRUE
```

Without this, the functions do not know how to match the `inds` and `cons` data and will fail so as not to return spurious results.

`weight()`
----------

(Re-)weighting is done with `weight()` which returns a data frame of raw weights.

``` r
weights <- weight(cons = cons, inds = inds, vars = vars)
weights
#>          a         b         c
#> A 1.227998 1.7250828 0.7250828
#> B 1.227998 1.7250828 0.7250828
#> C 3.544004 0.5498344 1.5498344
#> D 1.544004 4.5498344 2.5498344
#> E 4.455996 1.4501656 5.4501656
```

The raw weights tell you how frequently each individual (`A`-`E`) should appear in each zone (`a`-`c`). The raw weights are useful when validating and checking performance of the model, so it can be necessary to save these separately. They aren't very useful for analysis however, so we can `integerise()` or `extract()` them into a useable form.

`integerise()`
--------------

`integerise()` is useful when:

-   You need to include numerical variables, such as income in the example.
-   You want individual cases to use as input to a dynamic or agent-based model.
-   You want 'case studies' to illustrate characteristics of individuals in an area.
-   Individual-level data is more intuitive to work with.

``` r
int_weights <- integerise(weights, inds = inds)
int_weights[1:6, ]
#>     id    age sex income zone
#> 1    A a_gt50   m   2868    a
#> 1.1  A a_gt50   m   2868    a
#> 2    B a_gt50   m   2474    a
#> 3    C  a0_49   m   2231    a
#> 3.1  C  a0_49   m   2231    a
#> 3.2  C  a0_49   m   2231    a
```

`integerise()` returns one row per case, and the number of rows will match the known population (taken from `cons`).

`extract()`
-----------

`extract()`, on the other hand, is more precise as the returned information is fractional, although the user should be careful this isn't spurious precision based on context and knowledge of the domain.

To use `extract()` any numeric variables (such as income in the example) should be `cut()` or removed.

``` r
inds$income <- cut(inds$income, breaks = 2, include.lowest = TRUE,
                   labels = c("low", "high"))

ext_weights <- extract(weights, inds = inds, id = "id")
ext_weights
#>   code total a0_49 a_gt50 f m     high      low
#> 1    a    12     8      4 6 6 2.772002 9.227998
#> 2    b    10     2      8 6 4 6.274917 3.725083
#> 3    c    11     7      4 8 3 3.274917 7.725083
```

`extract()` returns one row per zone, and the total of each category (for example female and male, or high and low income) will match the known population.

`rake()`
--------

`rake()` is a wrapper for `weight() %>% integerise()` or `weight() %>% extract()`; useful if the raw weights are not required. The desired output is specified with the `output` argument, which can be specified with `"fraction"` (the default) or `"integer"` for `extract()` or `integerise()` respectively. The function takes the following arguments in all cases:

-   `cons`
-   `inds`
-   `vars`
-   `output` (default `"fraction"`)
-   `iterations` (default 10)

Additional arguments are required depending on the output requested. For `output = "fraction"`:

-   `id`

For `output = "integer"`:

-   `method` (default `"trs"`)
-   `seed` (default 42)

Details of these context-specific arguments can be found in the respective documentation for `integerise()` or `extract()`.

``` r
rake_int <- rake(cons, inds, vars, output = "integer",
                 method = "trs", seed = 42)
rake_int[1:6, ]
#>     id    age sex income zone
#> 1    A a_gt50   m   high    a
#> 1.1  A a_gt50   m   high    a
#> 2    B a_gt50   m    low    a
#> 3    C  a0_49   m    low    a
#> 3.1  C  a0_49   m    low    a
#> 3.2  C  a0_49   m    low    a
```

``` r
rake_frac <- rake(cons, inds, vars, output = "fraction", id = "id")
rake_frac
#>   code total a0_49 a_gt50 f m     high      low
#> 1    a    12     8      4 6 6 2.772002 9.227998
#> 2    b    10     2      8 6 4 6.274917 3.725083
#> 3    c    11     7      4 8 3 3.274917 7.725083
```
