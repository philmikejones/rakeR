## R CMD check results
* There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs


## Version numbering
* This version is backwards-imcompatible for one function (simulate())
* I have not incremented the major version number because the API is not yet
mature.
* If CRAN require a major version increment I will do this, however.


## Test environments
* Local Ubuntu Linux (16.06 Xenial) 64-bit, R 3.4.0
* Ubuntu Linux (12.04.5 Precise) on Travis-CI, R 3.4.0
* win-builder (devel 2016-11-13 r71655) with devtools::build_win()
