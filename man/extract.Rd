\usage{
extract(weights, inds, id)
}
\arguments{
\item{weights}{A weight table, typically produced by rakeR::weight()}

\item{inds}{The individual level data}

\item{id}{The unique id variable in the individual level data (inds),
usually the first column}
}
\value{
A data frame with zones and aggregated simulated values for each
variable
}
\description{
Extract aggregate weights from individual weight table
}
\details{
Extract aggregate weights from individual weight table, typically produced
by rakeR::weight()

Extract cannot operate with numeric variables because it creates a new
variable for each unique factor of each variable
If you want numeric information, like income, use integerise() instead.
